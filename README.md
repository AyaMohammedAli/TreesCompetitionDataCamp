# TreesCompetitionDataCamp
You work for a nonprofit organization advising the planning department on ways to improve the quantity and quality of trees in New York City. The urban design team believes tree size (using trunk diameter as a proxy for size) and health are the most desirable characteristics of city trees. The city would like to learn more about which tree species are the best choice to plant on the streets of Manhattan.
